Getting a student loan without parental support is possible, but it’s important to understand the differences between how federal student loan and private student loan programs work. 

In general, students can almost always qualify for a federal student loan, but there are borrowing limits, and you will usually have to include your parent’s information on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). There are some exceptions if you can prove independent status. For private student loans, you can borrow without a parent, but getting a student loan without a co-signer can be a challenge.
